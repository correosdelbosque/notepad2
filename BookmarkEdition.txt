 ---- Notepad2 Bookmark Edition (Release 1) -------------------------

      Coded by RL Vision - www.rlvision.com

 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Bookmark Edition is a modification to Notepad2 that adds bookmark 
 functionality plus some other tweaks and enhancements:

  - Bookmark feature:
  
		Ctrl+F2: toggle bookmark on/off for for current line
		F2: jump to next bookmark
		Shift+F2: jump to previous bookmark
		Alt+F2: clear all bookmarks
		
		Bookmarked lines are coloured light green. If the "Selection 
		margin" is enabled, a green icon is displayed there instead.

  - Re-Mapped "Save as" to F12 (F6 still works though)

  - Number of selected lines is reported in the statusbar together 
    with the other statistics ("Sel Ln")

  - Added wildcard search mode to the Find/Replace dialogs.
    Use * and ? as wildcards.

  - Added help buttons [?] to the Find/Replace dialogs with quick 
    syntaxt help for Regular Expressions, Backslash transformations 
    and Wildcard search.

  - "Convert to Title Case" has been tweaked to work better with 
    some apostrophes situations

  - The Find/Replace dialogs will automatically paste the clipboard 
    content first time it is opened (but only if nothing is selected 
    in the editor)

  - Some hotkeys have been reassigned or removed in order to accomodate 
    changes above:

		Select to next: Alt+Ctrl+F3 (Previously F2)
		Select to prev: Alt+Shift+F3 (Previously Ctrl+F2)
		
		Select syntax scheme: Shift+F12 (Previously F12)
		Customize schemes: Removed (Previously Ctrl+F12)



 ---- Source Code ---------------------------------------------------

 Source code for Bookmark Edition is available at www.rlvision.com

 This archive contains the complete source code project, including 
 Scintilla and my modifications. (It was tricky to get it to compile, 
 so I'm distributing everything in case someone else needs it.)

 All source code changes have been coded within BOOKMARK_EDITION
 #ifdef sections and most of them comments on what it does. Changes
 in the resource files are not documented since it is a generated file.



---- Notes on Compiling ---------------------------------------------

 It can be tricky to get compile Notepad2 the first time. Here are 
 some things I stumbled upon:
 
  * In the src\Notepad2.rs file, I had to remove this line:
    
    IDR_RT_MANIFEST         RT_MANIFEST             "..\\res\\Notepad2.exe.manifest"
 
  * One time Visual Studio replaced "winres.h" with "afxres.h" in
    "Notepad2.rc" and I had to change it back manually to ge the 
    "wdkbuild" script to compile.
 
  * It is possible to compile with Visual C++ Express Edition, but
    since it does not have a resource editor you can not easily change
    dialogs, hotkeys etc. There are 3rd part editors that might work
    though. (The built in resource editor is a påain toi work with 
    anyway...)
  
  * The final step in compiling is to run the "wdkbuild" script. In 
    order to get it working I had to modify the X86 paths slightly
    to work with my (default) installation: "\x86" to "\x86\x86"
    
  * "wdkbuild" refused the embed the Manifest file when linking. I 
    finally solved it by adding the manifest manually using 
    "XNResourceEditor.exe"
